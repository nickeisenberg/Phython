Kevin O'Leary is a piece of shit! Some tidbits from his CNBC interview:

* He's not convinced SBF  engaged in fraud (WTF????)
* Would invest in Sam Bankman Fraud again (Are you fucking nuts???)
* Received $15 million in Comp from backing and endorsing FTX but only lost $9 million (Cry me a river...)
* When Kevin O'leary claimed he did "due diligence" before investing in FTX, admits his due diligence was based on what other investors thought of FTX and SBF and that SBF and his parents were "Americans"! (Sounds good to me!)
